Product 1 Modulo n,number theory,Was trying to find some type of pattern or some type of mathematical relation.,"It uses a number theory concept that if {a1,a2…...an} are relatively prime then
{a1*a2*……*an} =  +/-(1) mod(n)
Hence further extending this if it is -1 then
product must be equal to some a(i) excluding it
would be the answer.","link-1
